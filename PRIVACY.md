Privacy policy GRGate GitHub App
================================

This document covers the use of the opensource GRGate GitHub App. This service
is provided by myself ([@etiennetremel](https://github.com/etiennetremel)) and
is intended for use as is.

## Overview

Installing the GRGate GitHub App explicitly grants us access to some of the
data you've shared with GitHub. This can include personal data, source code
repository content, and repository metadata.

All permissions required and actions taken to run the app are listed in this
repository. This application do not download any content besides the
`.grgate.yaml` file. Contents write permission is required to publish releases.

GRGate does not collect any data and do not store data on our servers besides a
temporary storage of log files which is kept for less than 30 days.

## Hosting Provider

The GRGate GitHub App is hosted on GCP, therefore its own privacy policies
apply.
